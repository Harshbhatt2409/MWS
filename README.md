With advancements in technology, smartphones, cameras, and sensors are becoming increasingly advanced and can help collect large amounts of data. With the use of these technologies, we can keep a watch on our loved ones and prevent them from injuring themselves. With the help of our project, we wanted to tackle the problem of patients and elder peoples falling at their homes and hospitals and notifies either their caretakers or any other member of the family so that we can keep a track of their health and make sure that they are safe. Hence to tackle this problem we made use of smartphones, Pi camera and wearable sensors. In our project, Pi Camera tracks the movement of the person and notifying when a person is in the room or when there’s no person in room and with the help of pose estimation we figure out when there’s a fall. The wearable sensors also help figure out fall in person and help detect fall when the Camera is unable to capture images or when there’s no camera in the room. And thus, we wish to tackle this problem by notifying the caretakers or other family members when their loved ones are in the room and when they have had a fall. With this project we wish to reduce the injuries caused by falls in hospital patients and other senior peoples at their homes or other areas. 

The project was divided into three main sections by our team. The first section was to create a mobile application that could store the information of the patients and notify the caretakers and patients’ contacts when something occurs. The second section was to handle servers and work with the sensors. This was the bridge between the work done on raspberry Pi and the mobile application and the last section was to work on the raspberry pi. My part in this project was to work on Raspberry PI and Pi Camera and perform two major tasks, first one being figuring out a way to track the movements of the patients and notifying when they have entered the room and left the room and the second one being fall detection. Here we will talk about all the how I managed to achieve my part of the project.

Taking inspiration from previous authors work we also decided to use Pose Estimation for fall detection. MoveNet is an ultra-fast and accurate model that detects 17 keypoints of a body. There are two commercially available variants called Lightning and Thunder. Lightning is used for latencycritical applications and Thunder is used for applications that require high accuracy. Both variants support over 30+ frames per second on modern laptops and desktops. It works on bottom-up estimation model, and it uses heatmaps to accurately localize human keypoints.
